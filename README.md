## Description
I have designed this website to showcase all of my hard work. The website's sole purpose is to function as a Porfolio where my projects and progress will be on display in an organized fashion for all of my future employers and fellow coders to see.

I also want to continue to update this website and use it as an opportunity to showcase my capabilitiies, skill set, and projects.
